Easy Git AutoHotkey

This is designed for myself, but anyone can use it. Basically it changes my Browser Favorites multimedia key into a button that opens Git Bash if not open already, brings it to the front window if it is open BUT not the active window, or closes it if it is the active window.

I definitely welcome anyone to fork this and edit it to make it work better if possible.

Usage Instructions
===========

* You will need to have [AutoHotkey](http://autohotkey.com) installed and have a basic understanding of how to use it (I can't help you there, sorry).
* To change the button that gets pressed to run the script, edit the first line of the script to the [button of your choice](http://www.autohotkey.com/docs/KeyList.htm).

Known Issues
===========

* Not exactly an issue, but I want to be able to specify a "Start in" directory, since it starts in <pre>/c/Program Files (x86)/AutoHotkey</pre>.

Changelog
===========

### 1.0
* Initial Release
